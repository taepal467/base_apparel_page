- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

-How to display two different size images based upon the screen size being used.

-I finally figured out how to do the client-side form validation. The key is, when using a regular expression, it is best to use either the 
.test() method or the .match() method to validate that the input value matches the regular expression. 

Example: element.value.match(Regex);


### Continued development

- Using JavaScript for form validation. 
- Mobile-first Workflow

### Useful resources

- [Email validation resource](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/javascript-tutorial/email-validation-in-javascript) - This helped me learn how to validate an email address by using regular expressions.
- [Data Validation](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/form-validation-with-html5-and-javascript/) - This helped me to start off how to do the form validation. I just changed the code around a bit.
